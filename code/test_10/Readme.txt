These tests do not simulate a positive workflow. Rather they try an attempt
to click on the reCAPTCHA checkbox in two different ways which do not work.

After many time of research on google I aske a question on stackoverflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72277761/testcafe-click-on-checkbox-inside-a-virtual-element-document

It seems that it the source of the iframe bellongs to a different domain the
elements inside the iframe cannot be accessed.
